<p id="portfolio">I am new to collecting my work for it to be displayed or used as evidence...Therefore, I only have a few examples of my creations. However, I have been mixing live sound, editing photographs, and performing other related items for upwards of 10 years now. Click on the items below to be taken to external websites, seperate from this site, to see examples of my work.</p>

<p id="portfoliocaption1">This website displays numerous projects that involved Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe Audition. Each project required myself to create an item entirely based on the unit I was wanting to teach and the content I wished to convey to my students. The project shown is largely based around the basics of economics for a third-grade audience. You are welcome to click the image to be taken to an external Wix site, seperate from this website.</p>
